In this scenario, we run a simple test which brings up a terminal and VSCode side by side. We will load Neo4j Docker image and run it as well. Katacoda is a tool for creating and hosting interactive
labs and tutorials to help introduce and train team members on a wide variety of topics. Each training session is called a scenario. A scenario plays out via a series of scripted steps which includes textual description and can also include an interactive terminal, code editor, notebook
and many other web based tools.
