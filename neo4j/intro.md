Katacoda is a tool for creating and hosting interactive labs & tutorials to help introduce new concepts and train team members on new tech and tooling. Labs run on fully managed, cloud hosted virtualized environments hosted by O'Reilly Media. A scenario plays out via a series of scripted steps which can include textual description, interactive commands and terminal, code & text editor, iframe for web apps, etc.

In this specific scenario, we run will configure Neo4j Graph database as a server as well as CLI tools and demonstrate usage on CLI, via Python script and Jupyter notebooks.
