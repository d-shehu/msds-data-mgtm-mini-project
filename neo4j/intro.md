Katacoda is a tool for creating and hosting interactive labs & tutorials to help introduce new concepts and tooling. Labs run on fully managed, virtualized environments hosted on the cloud by O'Reilly Media. These labs are called scenarios with each scenario playing out a series of scripted steps which can include textual description, interactive terminal, code & text editor, iframe for web apps, quizzes and much more.

In this  scenario, you will run configure Neo4j Graph database as a server as well as client using the CLI tools and Jupyter notebook. Will also demonstrate how to host Firefox web browser locally
to work around proxy configuration issues. The scenario includes some sample queries and demo code.
