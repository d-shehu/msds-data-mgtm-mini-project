## Neo4j Browser

Now we've installed and are running Neo4J server and and client side tooling
let's bring up a web browser with Neo4J dashboard. This is a bit tricky due
to security restrictions. Run the following command to embed Firefox
`./katacoda-scenarios/neo4j/scripts/setup_firefox.sh`{{execute}}

Give it a few minutes and the link below should take you to the embedded browser.
Login with username neo4j and password test. Take a few minutes to look around.
