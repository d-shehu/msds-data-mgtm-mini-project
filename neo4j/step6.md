## Hello Neo4j World

Now we've installed all the components for this lab. Let's do a "hello world"
Neo4J script. First double check that Jupyter has come up. If not give it
a few minutes.

In this environment, we've included a "scripts" folder with a simple Python
program call "helloneo.py". You can access it by clicking on the IDE and finding
the file in the directory under /home/root/katacoda-scenarios/neo4j/scripts.

Copy/paste the program into Jupyter notebook and run. You should be able to 
confirm the graph elements were created. Checkout it out in Neo4J browser.
