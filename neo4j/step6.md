## Neo4j Examples with Python & Jupyter 

Now we've installed all required components for this lab. Let's run the a Jupyter
notebook that demonstrates how to create a graph database and run some queries. 
First double check that Jupyter has come up. If not give it a few minutes or try
restarting it. See previous step.

In this environment, we've included a simple Hell World "scripts" called helloneo.py
that can be run via Python CLI. The easiest way is to access the Jupyter container's
CLI which has all the dependencies needed to run the sample code.

There is also the more advanced program call "Neo4j_MiniProject.py". You can access it 
by clicking on the IDE and finding the file in the directory under /home/root/katacoda-scenarios/neo4j/scripts.

Copy/paste the program into Jupyter notebook and run. You should be able to 
confirm the graph elements were created. Checkout it out in Neo4J browser.
